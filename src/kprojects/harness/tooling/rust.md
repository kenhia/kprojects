- Rust managed by `cargo`; format with `cargo fmt`, lint with
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` (test targets included deliberately — a gate
  that skips them is a gate that lies)
- Mirror `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml` and `clippy.toml` from a
  sibling homelab repo rather than generating them
